        <p>Hi! I'm Tyler of California and am an American software developer and musician, chiefly known for my role in the Plastic Rebellion.</p>
        <p>I am one of the first to recognize that calling yourself iconoclastic is obnoxious and not recommended.</p>
        <p>In my free time I like to read about politics, scientific developments, engineering, and technology. I also like to gamble.</p>
        <p>Fun fact! I put on my pants one leg at at time just like you!</p>

        <ul>
            <li>Coffee Club</li>
            <div class="image-container">
                <img src="./resources/images/Coffee_Club_CoffeeGrounds.avif">
            </div>
            <p>In this project I built a website for a coffee club. It was an exercise to practice responsive website design. I used HTML and CSS to develop this project.</p>
            <li>Credit Card Checker</li>
            <div class="image-container">
                <img src="./resources/images/Credit_Card_Checker.avif">
            </div>
            <p>In this project I built an algorith which determined the validity of any given credit card number. Then it displayed which credit card company had issued the card. I used Javascript to develop the program.</p>
            <li>Mystery Organism</li>
            <div class="image-container">
                <img src="./resources/images/Mystery_Organism.avif">
            </div>
            <p>For this project, I built a program which constructed random pairings of genetic bases and then determined whether those pairings would survive based on arbitrary criteria. I used Javascript to develop this piece of software.</p>
        </ul>
